# String Reversal Kata

## Objective
Write a function that reverses a given string without using built-in reverse functions.

## Requirements
1. Given a string, return the reversed version of it.
2. Preserve the case and position of special characters.
3. Optimize for readability and performance.

## Examples
- `hello` → `olleh`
- `Java!` → `!avaJ`
- `racecar` → `racecar` (palindromes remain unchanged)

## Bonus Challenge
- Implement the solution recursively.
- Reverse only the letters, keeping special characters in place (e.g., `a!b@c` → `c!b@a`).
