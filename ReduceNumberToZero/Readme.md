# ReduceNumberToZero

This project demonstrates a simple algorithm that reduces a number to zero by repeatedly applying operations depending on whether the number is even or odd.

## Problem Statement

The task is to reduce a given number to zero using the following rules:
- If the number is even, divide it by 2.
- If the number is odd, subtract 1.

The goal is to find the most efficient way to reduce the number to zero.

## Features

- Implements the logic to reduce a number to zero using basic arithmetic operations.
- Includes an interactive way to test different numbers.
- Optimized solution to handle large numbers efficiently.
